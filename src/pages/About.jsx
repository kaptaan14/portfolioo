        I want to develop things that have a tangible impact on peopleâ€™s lives.
        I believe more in practical than theory. So i try to code regularly and
        learn new things. I'm driven by the belief that technology has the power
        to transform the world for the better.

        I also love playing chess, reading books which improves my critical
        thinking. I believe in living life to the fullest and finding
        inspiration in every moment.
